/*
 * libelizainference FFI ABI v12.
 *
 * (Banner tracks ELIZA_INFERENCE_ABI_VERSION below; the per-version history is
 * at the end of this header preamble, newest first.)
 *
 * Single source of truth for the C-callable surface that the fused
 * omnivoice + llama.cpp build (`libelizainference.{dylib,so,dll}`)
 * exposes. Consumed today by the Node FFI loader at
 * `packages/app-core/src/services/local-inference/voice/ffi-bindings.ts`,
 * and intended to be consumed unchanged by the Capacitor (mobile) and
 * Electrobun (desktop) bridges as they come online.
 *
 * All entry points are `extern "C"` (no name mangling) so any FFI
 * loader (bun:ffi, node-ffi, koffi, JNI, Swift, Rust, Python) sees the
 * same symbol set. The shape was intentionally small + synchronous in
 * v1 to match Wave-4-C's lifecycle contract:
 *   - opaque context pointer, created from a bundle root
 *   - mmap acquire/evict for voice on/off
 *   - synchronous TTS / ASR forward passes.
 *
 * ABI v2 is the streaming voice surface. It adds:
 *   - the streaming ASR session API
 *     (`eliza_inference_asr_stream_open/feed/partial/finish/close`) so a
 *     `StreamingTranscriber` (see voice/transcriber.ts) can feed PCM
 *     frames and read a running partial transcript without buffering the
 *     whole utterance JS-side;
 *   - streaming TTS (`eliza_inference_tts_synthesize_stream` +
 *     `eliza_inference_cancel_tts` + `eliza_inference_tts_stream_supported`)
 *     so OmniVoice emits PCM chunks as they decode and the JS scheduler
 *     can phrase-chunk → TTS within one scheduler tick and hard-cancel an
 *     in-flight forward pass on barge-in (AGENTS.md §4);
 *   - the native DFlash verifier callback
 *     (`eliza_inference_set_verifier_callback`) so the JS scheduler drives
 *     phrase-chunking + rollback off exact native accept/reject events
 *     from the fork's speculative loop, not synthesized SSE deltas.
 * All ABI v2 additions are *additive symbols* — a v1 caller is
 * unaffected — but the version bumps so loaders can require v2 for the
 * streaming path. The batch `eliza_inference_asr_transcribe` and
 * `eliza_inference_tts_synthesize` stay for one-shot callers.
 *
 * ABI v3 adds the native Silero VAD surface:
 *   - the "vad" mmap region for VAD weights / runtime pages;
 *   - `eliza_inference_vad_supported/open/process/reset/close`, matching
 *     the JS Silero contract: 16 kHz, 512-sample windows, one speech
 *     probability per window.
 *
 * ABI v4 adds the OmniVoice frozen-voice preset surface:
 *   - the runtime resolves `speaker_preset_id` against
 *     `<bundle_dir>/cache/voice-preset-<id>.bin` (ELZ2 v2) on every TTS
 *     call and applies the persisted `(instruct, ref_audio_tokens, ref_T,
 *     ref_text)` triple to `ov_tts_params`. v3 callers that passed
 *     `speaker_preset_id == NULL` (auto-voice) keep that behaviour;
 *     `speaker_preset_id == "default"` / `"samantha"` / etc. now resolve
 *     to a real preset file instead of being misread as a VoiceDesign
 *     attribute string.
 *   - `eliza_inference_encode_reference` is added so the freeze CLI can
 *     pre-encode a reference WAV's HuBERT+RVQ tokens once and persist
 *     them in the preset file. Symbol is additive — v3 callers that
 *     don't use it are unaffected.
 *
 * ABI v5 adds the native wake-word surface (already consumed by the
 * Bun loader in `ffi-bindings.ts`):
 *   - `eliza_inference_wakeword_supported/open/score/reset/close`,
 *     mirroring the openWakeWord three-stage streaming pipeline
 *     (melspec → embedding → classifier head): 16 kHz mono fp32,
 *     1280-sample (80 ms) frames, one P(wake) in [0, 1] per call,
 *     streaming state reset at utterance boundaries. The fused build
 *     resolves the three head GGUFs
 *     (`<bundle_dir>/wake/<head>.{melspec,embedding,classifier}.gguf`)
 *     from the context bundle + the head name passed at open.
 *
 * ABI v6 fuses the remaining standalone voice classifiers into the
 * single libelizainference handle so the whole voice pipeline runs
 * through one native lib (replaces the separate
 * `libvoice_classifier.{so,dylib}` standalone). Both additions own a
 * context-anchored session and call the vendored scalar-C forward
 * graphs under `tools/omnivoice/src/voice-classifiers/`:
 *   - `eliza_inference_speaker_supported/open/embed/free/close` — the
 *     WeSpeaker ResNet34-LM 256-d speaker-embedding encoder. 16 kHz
 *     mono fp32 in, one L2-normalized 256-float embedding out, for
 *     cosine-distance speaker matching.
 *   - `eliza_inference_diariz_supported/open/segment/close` — the
 *     pyannote-segmentation-3.0 diarizer. A fixed 80000-sample (5 s)
 *     16 kHz mono fp32 window in, a per-frame powerset-label sequence
 *     (293 int8 labels, one per frame) out.
 * All v5/v6 additions are additive symbols — a v4 caller is
 * unaffected — but the version bumps so loaders can require the new
 * surfaces. Older fused builds that report a lower version are still
 * usable at degraded capability via the per-symbol `*_supported()`
 * probes.
 *
 * ABI v7 promotes the native Silero VAD surface (the v3 symbols
 * `eliza_inference_vad_supported/open/process/reset/close`) from a stub
 * (`vad_supported() == 0`, every entry returned NOT_IMPLEMENTED) to a
 * real backend. It fuses the last standalone voice runtime — the
 * Silero v5 LSTM speech detector — into libelizainference, replacing
 * the separate `libsilero_vad.{so,dylib}` standalone, so all FOUR voice
 * classifiers (VAD, wake-word, speaker, diarizer) now run through one
 * fused handle. The wrapper owns a context-anchored session, resolves
 * the Silero GGUF from `<bundle_dir>/vad/` (conventionally
 * `silero-vad-v5.gguf`), and drives the vendored scalar-C forward graph
 * under `tools/omnivoice/src/voice-classifiers/vad/`. No new symbols are
 * added — `vad_supported()` simply now returns 1 and the four entries do
 * real work — so a v3..v6 caller that already bound the VAD surface
 * gains a working backend with no recompile. The version bumps so
 * loaders can require a build whose `vad_supported()` is real.
 *
 * Errors are propagated via heap-allocated `char *` strings written to
 * `out_error` arguments; callers MUST free them with
 * `eliza_inference_free_string`. A NULL `out_error` parameter is a
 * programmer error (caller skipped diagnostics) and the library is
 * permitted to crash. Per AGENTS.md §3 + §9 the library never logs
 * and never returns a defaulted result on failure.
 *
 * Status codes are plain int. Successful calls return >= 0; failures
 * return one of the negative `ELIZA_*` constants below.

/* Bump on any breaking shape change. The Node loader checks the value
 * returned by `eliza_inference_abi_version()` against this constant on
 * load and refuses to bind if they disagree.
 *
 * Changelog:
 *   v13: token-by-token vision describe. `eliza_inference_vision_stream_supported()`
 *        + `_describe_image_stream` run the SAME mmproj-prefill + greedy decode as
 *        `_describe_image`, but invoke an `eliza_vision_chunk_cb` with each decoded
 *        UTF-8 text piece as it is produced (then once more with `is_final == 1`),
 *        so the IMAGE_DESCRIPTION handler streams a description into the dashboard
 *        through the SAME per-token pipe as chat text (mirrors the streaming-TTS
 *        `eliza_tts_chunk_cb` cancellation contract). Additive symbols — a v12
 *        caller is unaffected; a v12 library reports `vision_stream_supported() == 0`
 *        and the loader falls back to the buffered `_describe_image`. Gated on the
 *        same `-DELIZA_ENABLE_VISION=1` build flag.
 *   v12: ASR word timestamps folded into the fused ASR.
 *        `eliza_inference_asr_timestamps_supported()` + `_asr_transcribe_timed`
 *        run the SAME audio-in/text-out decode as `_asr_transcribe` and
 *        additionally return per-word [start_ms, end_ms) spans. Qwen3-ASR is
 *        autoregressive (no acoustic frame alignment, and this build's
 *        flash-attention fuses the QK-softmax so cross-attention is not
 *        materialized), so the timing is the honest single-model signal:
 *        duration-proportional, character-weighted, monotonic over the cleaned
 *        transcript words, anchored on the exactly-known total audio duration
 *        (T_ms = 1000 * n_samples / sample_rate_hz). Single pipe — every
 *        platform that loads the fused lib gets word-synced transcripts.
 *        Additive symbols — a v11 caller is unaffected; a v11 library reports
 *        `asr_timestamps_supported() == 0` and the loader falls back to the
 *        text-only `_asr_transcribe`.
 *   v11: end-of-turn scoring folded in-process. `eliza_inference_llm_eot_supported()`
 *        + `_llm_eot_score` run a single causal forward pass over a tokenized
 *        partial transcript and read the next-token probability of the
 *        end-of-turn marker (e.g. <|im_end|>), replacing the retired
 *        node-llama-cpp `controlledEvaluate()` the EOT classifiers needed. The
 *        model-based EOT detector now runs through the fused lib instead of a
 *        JS-only heuristic. Additive symbols — a v10 caller is unaffected; a
 *        v10 library reports `llm_eot_supported() == 0` and the loader keeps
 *        the heuristic classifier.
 *   v10: Kokoro-82M TTS folded in-process. `eliza_inference_kokoro_supported()`
 *        + `_load` + `_synthesize` + `_sample_rate` link kokoro_lib (its own
 *        GGUF reader + iSTFT decoder) into the fused handle so the mobile
 *        Kokoro path stops POSTing to the local-TCP `llama-server
 *        /v1/audio/speech` route (forbidden on iOS / Google Play). Gated on
 *        the `ELIZA_ENABLE_KOKORO` build flag (TARGET kokoro_lib); a build
 *        without it reports `kokoro_supported() == 0` and the synth entries
 *        return ELIZA_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. Additive symbols — a v9 caller is
 *        unaffected.
 *   v9: the last text-adjacent modalities move off their separate libs into
 *       the fused handle. Three additive entrypoints + probes:
 *         - `eliza_inference_embed` + `eliza_inference_embed_supported()` —
 *           pooled text embeddings over a dedicated embedding context
 *           (`llama_set_embeddings(true)` + pooling + `llama_get_embeddings_seq`),
 *           mirroring desktop-llama-adapter.ts's `embed()`. Retires the
 *           `node-llama-cpp` embedding path: the default TEXT_EMBEDDING handler
 *           routes through the fused lib.
 *         - `eliza_inference_describe_image` +
 *           `eliza_inference_vision_supported()` — mmproj vision for the TEXT
 *           model, reusing the mtmd machinery already linked for ASR
 *           (`mtmd_helper_bitmap_init_from_buf`, `mtmd_tokenize`,
 *           `mtmd_helper_eval_chunks`). Gated on the `-DELIZA_ENABLE_VISION=1`
 *           build flag. Drops the libllama+shim mmproj vision path.
 *         - `eliza_inference_tokenize` / `eliza_inference_detokenize` +
 *           `eliza_inference_tokenize_supported()` + `eliza_inference_free_tokens`
 *           (reused) — expose `llama_tokenize` / `llama_detokenize` over the
 *           loaded text model's vocab so the desktop fused runtime stops
 *           standing up a libllama tokenizer sidecar.
 *       All v9 additions are additive symbols — a v8 caller is unaffected.
 *       The version bumps so loaders can require the new surfaces; older
 *       fused builds are still usable at degraded capability via the per-symbol
 *       `*_supported()` probes (absent symbol == unsupported).
 *   v8: streaming-LLM text path reaches feature parity with the
 *       libllama+eliza-llama-shim path. `eliza_llm_stream_config_t` grows
 *       `cache_type_k` / `cache_type_v` (KV-cache quant pass-through; names
 *       mapped to ggml_type) and `n_gpu_layers` (per-load GPU offload,
 *       replacing the ELIZA_LLM_USE_GPU env hardcode). The `_open` path now
 *       builds a same-file MTP speculative driver when `mtp_drafter_path`
 *       is set (reusing common/speculative.cpp's DRAFT_MTP engine) and
 *       `_next` drives draft+verify, populating drafter_drafted/accepted.
 *       New capability probes `eliza_inference_llm_mtp_supported()` and
 *       `eliza_inference_llm_kv_quant_supported()` let the loader refuse a
 *       library that lacks these optimizations. sizeof config = 80.
 *   v7: real Silero VAD (same symbol surface as v6).
 *   v6: fused wake-word, speaker, diarizer.

 * the call — the same OmniVoice context is reused. Returns ELIZA_OK on
 * success, negative ELIZA_* on failure with `*out_error` populated.

 * model (logits at the final position), lazily created and reused, KV cleared
